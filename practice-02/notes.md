# YAML Basics

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format. It is often used for configuration files, data exchange between languages with different data structures, and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

## Indentation and Structure

YAML uses indentation to represent the structure of data. Spaces are preferred over tabs, and indentation should be consistent. It uses colons and dashes to denote key-value pairs and lists.

## Key-Value Pairs

Key-value pairs are used to represent data. The key and value are separated by a colon, with a space after the colon. For example:

```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
```


## Lists
Lists or arrays are represented using a hyphen followed by a space, and items in the list are indented. For example:
```
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
```
